# Dataset:
For all the experiments we used **Indian Supreme Court** proceedings.
# Judgemnet prediction:
Our primary focus in this study revolved around two types of judgments: "accept" and "reject." Consequently, this particular aspect posed a binary classification problem.

In the context of statute prediction, our main emphasis was on five IPC sections. The descriptions of these sections are provided below: <br>
**IPC 148**: Rioting, armed with a deadly weapon. <br>
**IPC 300**: When culpable homicide is not murder. <br>
**IPC 302**: Punishment for murder. <br>
